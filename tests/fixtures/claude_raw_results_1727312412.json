Meal Feedback and Planning:\n   - I've created a task for providing feedback on recent meals, due tomorrow (2023-05-15).\n   - I've also created tasks for planning meals for each day of the week, all due on 2023-05-14 (Sunday).\n\n2. To-do List:\n   - I've checked the open tasks using the list_tasks tool. However, the tool doesn't provide information about due dates, so I can't determine if any tasks are overdue. We may need to review the open tasks manually to identify any overdue items.\n\n3. New Content on the Site:\n   - Unfortunately, there isn't a specific tool available to check for new content on the site. This might be something we need to do manually or develop a new tool for in the future.\n\n4. Summary:\n   - Done: Created tasks for meal feedback and weekly meal planning.\n   - Needs Attention: \n     a) Review open tasks to identify any overdue items.\n     b) Manually check the site for new content.\n     c) Complete the meal planning tasks for each day of the week.\n     d) Provide feedback on recent meals (tomorrow).\n\nNow, let's inform the team about our weekly review. I'll send an email summarizing our activities and what needs attention."
