Meal Feedback and Planning:\n   - I've created a task to remind you to provide feedback on recent meals, due tomorrow (May 15, 2023).\n   - I've also created tasks for planning meals for each day of the next week, all due on Sunday (May 14, 2023).\n\n2. To-do List:\n   - I've used the list_tasks tool to check for open tasks. However, we'll need to manually review these to identify any overdue items. The system doesn't provide a way to automatically flag overdue tasks.\n\n3. New Website Content:\n   - There isn't a specific tool to check for new content on the site. This is something you'll need to do manually.\n\n4. Summary:\n   What's been done:\n   - Created tasks for meal feedback and weekly meal planning.\n   - Checked the list of open tasks.\n   - Sent an email to the team summarizing the current status and action items.\n\n   What needs attention:\n   - Review the open tasks to identify any overdue items.\n   - Check the website for any new, interesting content.\n   - Complete the meal planning tasks for each day of the week by Sunday.\n   - Provide feedback on recent meals tomorrow.\n\nI've sent an email to the team summarizing these points and highlighting the action items. Is there anything else you'd like me to do or any part you'd like me to elaborate on?"
