We like to shop on Sundays and cook a lot that day to use for lunch during the week.\nThen send the team and email with any updates.Help me make a weekly meal plan, with breakfast, lunch, dinner\nIdeally there are left overs for lunch so those recipes should be enough for 2 and that \n\nThen as the weeks go on ideally meals will change based on our feedback and not repeating all the time\n\nOut meal plan ideally is based on the following core ingredients\nfresh vegetables ideally seasonal.\nWe live in Massachusetts [TIME_OF_YEAR]\n\n\n\nWhere \nCarrots, potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms peppers and anything like that really.\n\nChicken breast, thighs etc. \nTurkey mince, beef steak, shrimp, sausage \n\nTofu  so not every night is meat though fish is great \n\nstir-fry is great, Dumplings, pesto etc.\n\nTacos nights a great with fish, pickled onions.\n\nSo as you can see mixes of fresh cooked foods.\n\nBreakfast can be simple just oatmeal, or toast and advocado",

If there is, maybe we should add some reminders to improve things for next time. If there is none make a Task to remind us to offer some feedback tomorrow. If there are Tasks to make like meal details for each day of the week make a task for each of those.\n\n2. Take a look at my to-do list. If anything's overdue, could you let the team know?\n\n3. See if there's any new stuff on our site. If you find anything interesting, let me know so I can check it out.\n\n4. Lastly, can you give me a quick summary of what's been done and what needs attention?\n\nThanks for your help!",
